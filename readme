For building examples for the book you will need following libraries:
	- GLM
	- freeglut
	- GLEW
	- assimp

For some examples you will need Qt and GLFW.

For Linux just install these libraries, then you can use cmake or 
Makefile.linux.

For Window you need explicitly to specify path to those libraries in 
nmake.inc or CMakeLists.txt files.
